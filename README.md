# fileUploadDemo
This example will allow one to browse for files to upload, and then display the uploaded files on the screen, providing both a delete function and also a function to view/download the uploaded file. Please provide feedback, there are probably cleaner ways to do this, especially with the action to start the upload... the "change" event seems less than ideal.
